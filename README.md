# To-do calendar

To do list in a calendar version.
This is a functional calendar, that allows moving to the next/previous months. Tasks can be added to every single day thanks to the use of dialog elements. 
The app has been developed using Ember JS. The styles are minimal to allow a basic view of the application.
